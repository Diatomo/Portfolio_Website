# Website Portfolio
This repository showcases the development of my portfolio website, designed to demonstrate my expertise in web development, Python, and the Flask framework. The site highlights a selection of past and current projects, offering a glimpse into my work that I hope others will find engaging. While primarily built for job applications, the portfolio will evolve with future updates to enhance its design and functionality.



### Projects  

1. **Music_Fest** - Visual and Audio of a ambient modular synthesizer performance I put together. The visual is microorganism footage from NPR's microsmos and added a kaleidoscope effects using Touch Designer.
2. **Photo_viewer** - Application to upload and view (like photos on a fridge) of family events that occur through the year. This application contains a drag and drop upload feature as well as utilizing dropbox as a data repository.
3. **Tri-vco** - At one point in time, I was highly interested in hardware, this is my capstone to create my own triple voltage controlled oscillator
4. **Synth-clips** - Improv session I have with a few friends, feel free to listen, it has helped me add structure to my writing and is a fun thing to look back on.
5. **TIAS** - Music project I did for an internet art course, it is a step sequencer built using javascript.
6. **Gravity** - Very early project, this was a weekend sketch I did, heavily inspired applying physics to graphics. This project utilizes processing.
7. **Asteroids** - First program I ever wrote, is going to live in my personal hall of fame.
8. **School Projects** - Github repo of projects I wrote in school, yes, I tried to record and keep everything.  
9... Beyond this point is a catalogue of art-installations I did in the span between 2017 through 2019. They're mainly arduino projects, some of which were very complex,
