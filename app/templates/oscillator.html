		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			The voltage controlled oscillator broken down into itâ€™s simplest parts is a Resistor - Capacitor (RC) circuit, 
			where a capacitor charges, raising the voltage level, and then discharges through the resistor causing the voltage 
			level to fall. However; in order to integrate this into a eurorack format we add several other components. 
			A mixer, an augmented oscillator core with a schmitt trigger and instead of a resistor, two transistors, and an 
			ac-coupled op-amp. All this is built on top of a bipolar 12V.

		<h3>Bipolar Power</h3>
		<p>
			The bipolar power is an important aspect of synthesizer electronics for two separate reasons. One, when voltage 
			is mapped to an oscillation every voltage level is mapped to a frequency. If we only had discrete voltages 
			between 0 volts and 5 volts, we would map that space to 128 notes. This would mean changing a note would be 0.04volts. 
			This voltage is so fine that it is difficult to get that granularity when utilizing a transistor as a control voltage resistor. 
			Two, operational amplifiers provide the best and easiest method to buffer and scale down our oscillation to fit 
			within the eurorack standard.

		<h3>Component One</h3>
		<p>
			The first component is a parallel mixing circuit. The mixing circuit is composed of a potentiometer, a resistor and a 
			thermistor, in series. The three components cut the 12 volt voltage level to a level low enough to make the transistor 
			act like a resistor, which happens to transistors when a low enough voltage level hits a transistors base. The flow of 
			current from the collector to the emitter is in a partial open and closed state, acting like a resistor.
