		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			HGRIC is the Human Genetics Research Informatics Core, housed in the biomedical research 
			tower at The Ohio State University. It serves hundreds of researchers by maintaining 
			a consortium database with more than thirty thousand patients. It processes
			millions of gene variants to look for a pattern in asymptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy.
		</p>

		<h2>Technology</h2>
		<p>
			We utilize a suite of all types of software akin to a full stack developer. The database is 
			built on db2, a relational database, inserted in a framework known as BioComputing or BC for short.
			BC comes with a suite of triggers and a form system to help non-technical users enter in data on a 
			day to day basis. However; when patient's progress through the study, HGRIC has built custom
			webportals using ag-grid and angular to highlight, show and describe information in the database.
			Typically, depending on what is being studied there are also Java classes that handle pipeline processes.
			This includes the download and processing of new genomic information, inventory reports of blood samples,
			and adjudication and generation of a patient's lab report. 
		</p>

		<h2>Skills</h2>
		<p>
			HGRIC has been my first full time software engineering job and I've learned a lot. From utilizing git commands
			and services every day to connecting custom made queries to a front end to display complex relationships in the
			data. I've also learned quite a bit about working with other software engineers and tracking, testing, and developing
			tickets using a kanban board, jira. It has all been very exciting and feel I can be more ambitious in my programming
			pursuits because of the experience.
