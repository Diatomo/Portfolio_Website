			I've always had a deep fascination for robots. When I began working I noticed a weak point in my engineering skills pertained to mechanical devices. Therefore, with some patients and saving I had the opprutunity
			to buy a 3D printer. At first, I built a hexapod from scrap off the internet. It was an interesting design; however, the servo motors were all pulse width modulated and the wires looked like the robot just woke
			up in the morning. Needless to say, the design was extremely flimsly and I never approriately got the thing to walk. After building my 3D printer, I didn't quite know where to start on building my own robot. I somehow
			ran into a github repository of a guy named Adam, who had designed and programmed a hexapod. I took his STL files (which were great!) and started printing. With his design I'm going to make my own modification and allow
			this robot to learn it's own body and methods of locomotion.

			I built a version of a hexapod from cutout parts that I bought online. All the hardware had to be sourced by me including the raspberry pi servo shield. I learned a lot about what I didn't like with this design.
			Namely the spaghetti of wires coming from the pwm servo motors, and the frailty of the parts. I decided to search for another design to remedy these issues.

			Next, I found a design from a guy named Adammck on github. I was impressed with the overall design and how it could be fabricated on a 3D printer. This meant that I could come up with modifications without having
			to buy another robot or start from scratch. His design gave me a convienant starting point to integrate servo motors, power supplies, accelerameters, and cameras to the hexapod. With that said, I decided to use
			NGEN as my material because of its safety (I print in my room) but also its flexibility. Soon after I received those materials I begin putting together a box of loose parts to begin assembling the hexapod.

			I'm about to begin the software step. I am deciding it would be best to utilize ROS as many robotics companies use this technology in their production robots. With a little review of geometry and trignometry I'm about ready,
			when I have time, to develop IK algorithms to allow the robot to walk. Hopefully that will coming soon!!
